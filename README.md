# **Oscar Web Store**
http://selenium1py.pythonanywhere.com/

### Welcome to Oscar's sandbox site.  This is a example install of Oscar, making very few customisations to the core.  It is intended as a playground for experimenting with Oscar's features. ###

1. The system should be the simplest example of an online store.
2. To get started, the user must authorize himself or enter as a guest
3. The Product must have the following attributes:
     - Unique number(string)
     - Name of product
     - Price
     - Availability
     - The number of goods for each item
4. You can order two types of goods:
     - Clothing
     - Books
5. System functions:
     - Creation of a new order with an arbitrary number of goods of different names.
     - It should be possible for the user to view all his orders sorted by the filter.
       The filter contains the following fields: Order number, Amount, Creation date and Quantity of items in the order.
 6. Additional requirements:
    - The system interface should consist of two parts - a header with a menu for accessing the system and workspace functions.
    - When creating a document, implement validation of input attributes both on the client side and on the server side.
    - The internal design of the application must be developed in accordance with the principles of OOP
    - Integration of the application object model must be done using an object-relational mapping framework of your choice
    - When implementing asynchronous calls, use the standard library
    - Use PostgreSQL as a database.
